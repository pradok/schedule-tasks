## Schedule Tasks: Project notes

  1. NestJS has been used due to well tried and tested patterns for modular code and dependencies.
  2. `ts-rest` with Zod is being used for api contract first approach and also used as Controller decorator for validations with Zod.
  3. Integration test files end with `.i-spec.ts`.
  4. Thunder collection `thunder-collection_local.json` has been provided in the root project to test api endpoints.

## Pending or to improve (Due to time constraints)

  1. Integration test for Task table (would be similar pattern as for Schedule), only Schedule table is done to demonstrate integration test.
  2. Better http response payload for validations instead of throwing raw Zod error responses.
  3. No Pagination provided for GET collection, ideally should have pagination.
